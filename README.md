You would be entering your year of brith , using which the program calculates your age , and shows whether you are eligible to vaccinate in a particular vaccination center.
The vaccination center details such as the no. of vaccines available and type of vaccine available are also shown.
You can select whichever is comfortable and confirm your appointment.
